## React + Vite + Typescript
# Codeleap Frontend
This app are being create with:
- React + Vite + Typescipt.
### Without TypeScript, for me, the code ends up being "dirty". So I decided to use TypeScript to type the files.
### I chose Vite because it's a small app and we need speed. Speed ​​for me to develop and for you to evaluate.
